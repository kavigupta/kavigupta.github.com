<p>The natural numbers are taught to children as a basic facet of mathematics. One of the first things we learn is how to count. In fact, the name â€œNatural Numbersâ€ itself implies that the natural numbers are basic.</p>

<p>However, modern mathematicians seem to have trouble with accepting the natural numbers as first class features of mathematics. In fact, there are not one but two common definitions of the naturals that can be used to prove the Peano Axioms (the basic axioms from which most of number theory can be proven).</p>
