<p>Last time, we discussed funcads, which are a generalization of functions that can have multiple or no values for each element in their input.</p>

<h2 id="composition-of-funcads">Composition of Funcads</h2>

<p>The composition of funcads is defined to be compatible with the composition of functions, and it takes a fairly similar form:</p>

<p>\[f :: Y \fcd Z \wedge f :: X \fcd Y \implies \exists (f \odot g :: X \fcd Z), (f \odot g)(x) = \bigcup_{\forall y \in g(x)} f(y)\]</p>

<p>In other words, map the second function over the result of the first and take the union. If you’re a Haskell programmer, you probably were expecting this from the title and the name “funcad”: the funcad composition rule is just Haskell’s <code>&gt;=&gt;</code>.</p>
