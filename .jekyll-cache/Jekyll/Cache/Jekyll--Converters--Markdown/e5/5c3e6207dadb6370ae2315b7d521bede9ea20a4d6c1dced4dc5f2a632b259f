<h2 id="two-view-of-monoids">Two View of Monoids.</h2>

<h3 id="monoids">Monoids</h3>

<p>Monoids are defined in Haskell as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">class Monoid a where
    m_id :: a
    (++) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>Monoids define some operation with identity (here called <code>m_id</code>). We can define
the required laws, identity, and associativity, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">monoidLaw1, monoidLaw2 :: (Monoid a, Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; Bool
monoidLaw1 x = x ++ m_id == x
monoidLaw2 x = m_id ++ x == x

monoidLaw3 :: (Monoid a, Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
monoidLaw3 x y z = (x ++ y) ++ z == x ++ (y ++ z)
</code></pre>
<!--end excerpt-->

<h3 id="morphisms">Morphisms</h3>

<p>Now, I’ll introduce something else:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">class (Morphism f) where
    id :: f x x
    (.) :: f b c -&gt; f a b -&gt; f a c
</code></pre>

<p>Morphisms also have laws:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">morphismLaw1, morphismLaw2 :: (Morphism f, Eq (f a b)) =&gt; f a b -&gt; Bool
morphismLaw1 f = f . id == f
morphismLaw2 f = id . f == f

morphismLaw3 :: (Morphism f, Eq (f a d)) =&gt; f c d -&gt; f b c -&gt; f a b -&gt; Bool
morphismLaw3 f g h = (f . g) . h == f . (g . h)
</code></pre>

<p>This definition defines a morphism, or a generalization of a function, in the
category of Haskell types.</p>

<p>We can make things instances of morphisms as such:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">instance (Morphism (-&gt;)) where
    id x = x
    (f . g) x = f (g x)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="morphisms-and-monoids">Morphisms and Monoids</h3>

<p>Note that while a Monoid is a concrete type, a Morphism is a higher-order-type that takes two types as inputs. However, apart from this, we have fairly similar set of given functions with a similar set of laws.</p>

<p>To make the comparison explicit, we can look at endomorphisms, that is morphisms from a set to itself.</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">data Endo morph set = Endo (morph set set)

instance (Morphism morph) =&gt; (Monoid (Endo morph set)) where
    m_id = Endo id
    Endo f ++ Endo g = Endo (f . g)
</code></pre>

<p>So, we can see that monoids can be viewed as morphisms from a set to itself. Here is a diagram of that. The elements of the monoid are the arrows.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/2016-05-07/monoid.svg.png" /></p>

<p>In any case, we now have a new way of expressing a monoid: as a set of morphisms from a set to itself.</p>

<h2 id="bioids">Bioids</h2>

<p>We can define a bioid to be the arrows between two objects. These fall into four different sets, those from \(A \to A\), those from \(A \to B\), those from \(B \to A\), and those from \(B \to B\). This can be represented diagrammatically as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/resources/2016-05-07/bioid.svg.png" /></p>

<p>If we want to enforce the laws of the category, we know that we need to enforce a monad structure on both \(A\) and \(B\). We also know that we must have four additional composition values. In Haskell syntax, we have:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">class (Monoid aa, Monoid bb) =&gt; Bioid aa bb ab ba
        | aa -&gt; ab, aa -&gt; ba, bb -&gt; ab, bb -&gt; ba, ab -&gt; aa, ab -&gt; bb, ba -&gt; aa, ba -&gt; bb, aa -&gt; bb, bb -&gt; aa, ab -&gt; ba, ba -&gt; ab where
    id_a :: aa
    id_b :: bb
    (%%) :: ab -&gt; ba -&gt; aa
    (^^) :: ba -&gt; ab -&gt; bb

    (#&gt;) :: ab -&gt; aa -&gt; ab
    (&lt;#) :: aa -&gt; ba -&gt; ba
    ($&gt;) :: bb -&gt; ab -&gt; ab
    (&lt;$) :: ba -&gt; bb -&gt; ba
</code></pre>

<p>OK, I don’t want to write down the laws for that mess. I now understand why mathematicians stopped at monoids but not bioids. To be completely honest, I was hoping to get semirings out of this mess, but I don’t think it’s actually possible.</p>

<h2 id="and-beyond">And Beyond</h2>

<p>In any case, we can still notice something interesting about a Bioid. It has a total of eight composition rules, if you include the two monoid rules. How can we calculate this number in general?</p>

<p>First, let’s define an n-oid as the morphisms on a category with \(n\) objects. We know that there are \(n^2\) types of morphisms (\(n\) sources and \(n\) destinations). We also know that each composition rule contains three types in any order:</p>

<p>\(\circ :: m b c \to m a b \to m b c\)</p>

<p>So there are therefore \(n^3\) <code>++</code> equivalents on an n-oid. Yeah, in general that’s going to get messy very fast.</p>
