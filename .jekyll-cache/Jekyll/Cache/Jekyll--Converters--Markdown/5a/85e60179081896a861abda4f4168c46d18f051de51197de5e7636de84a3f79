I"ß<p>So, a friend and I (Iâ€™m going to protect his anonymity in case he doesnâ€™t want to be associated with the travesty that is what we ended up thinking up) were discussing ridiculous ideas for programming languages: you know the deal, writing C interpreters in Python, using only integers to represent everything, etc.</p>

<p>One idea, however, seemed a little less ridiculous to us (OK, just to me): a language in which there are two data types: Dictionary and String.</p>
