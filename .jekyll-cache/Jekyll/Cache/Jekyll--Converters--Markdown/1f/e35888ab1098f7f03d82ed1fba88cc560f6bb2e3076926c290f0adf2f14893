<p>The efficiency gap is a technique for measuring the level of gerrymandering in a state. Gerrymandering generally takes the form of what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúcracking and packing.‚Äù Cracking is the process of taking a district with a majority of the opposing party and splitting it into two in which the party has a minority in each, thus denying your opponent that seat. However, this isn‚Äôt always possible because your opponent might have too many votes in a given area. To reduce the remaining number of votes your opponent has while minimizing the number of seats they have, you can use a technique called packing, in which you create a district in which your opponent can win by a huge margin.</p>

<p>To measure both cracking and packing, we can use the concept of a wasted vote. A wasted vote is any vote that did not contribute to the victory. There are two kinds of wasted votes, cracked waste and packed waste. A cracked wasted vote for party X is any vote in a district party X has lost. A packed wasted vote is any vote for party X over 50% in a district party X has won.</p>

<p>For example, let‚Äôs say that there are just two parties<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and 1000 voters in a district. The number of wasted votes for X in terms of the number of votes for X is as such:</p>

      <p>The United States has two political parties. A vote for the Green, Libertarian, or American Independent Party is a wasted vote. But if you‚Äôre voting for the AIP (the party that nominated Wallace), you <em>should</em> waste your vote, so I guess I‚Äôm fine if you vote for the AIP.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
