<p>We know that types can be used to encode how to make useful data structures.</p>

<p>For example, a vehicle can be encoded as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">data Vehicle = Car { vin :: Integer, licensePlate :: String }
        | Bike
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, valid values include cars with VINs and LPNs, or Bikes, which have neither of these data points.</p>

<p>However, some data types can seem far less useful.</p>
