<p>Regexes are truly amazing. If you haven’t heard of them, they are a quick way to find (and sometimes replace) some body of text with another body of text. The syntax, while it has its critics, is generally pretty intuitive; for example a zip code might be represented as</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">[0-9]{5}(\s*-\s*[0-9]{4})?
</code></pre>

<p>which is read as “a five digit code optionally followed by a spaced dash and a four digit code”. Some whitespace and named groups might help the reading (use <code>COMMENTS</code> mode when parsing)</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">(?P&lt;main_code&gt;
    [0-9]{5}
)
( # optional extension
    \s*-\s*     # padded dash
    (?P&lt;optional_extension&gt;
        [0-9]{4}
    )
)?
</code></pre>
