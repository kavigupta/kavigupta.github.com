I"ˇ<p>If you‚Äôre on twitter or Facebook you‚Äôve probably seen this expression (or a variant with different numbers) before</p>

<pre><code>6 √∑ 2(1+2)
</code></pre>

<p>The question that goes with it is ‚Äúcan you solve this?‚Äù and there‚Äôs usually a massive debate among people in the comments about whether the answer is 9 (corresponding to dividing first then multiplying by (1+2)) or 1 (corresponding to multiplying first to get 6 then dividing).</p>

<h1 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h1>

<p>One thing people often seem to be arguing about is PEMDAS/BODMAS: the system of precedence used to do these operations. The acronyms suggest a sequencing of multiplication and division, but the convention taught with them is that the two operations have equal precedence and should be left associatively evaluated. So the formula would parse as (6 √∑ 2)(1+2) and thus be equal to 9.</p>

<p>One common response to this from mathematicians and other more sophisticated observers is that people are arguing about a completely arbitrary convention, and really you should just parenthesize better. These folks are correct, but I think they‚Äôre missing something that makes this particular example unique. For example, I think most people would correctly recall and apply the PEMDAS rule to the formula</p>

<pre><code>6 - 1 + 3
</code></pre>

<p>I think most people would even correctly apply the rule to the formula</p>

<pre><code>6 √∑ 2 √ó (1 + 3)
</code></pre>

<p>There‚Äôs something unique about this formula that means that PEMDAS does not apply to it.</p>

<h1 id="the-implicit-multiplication-operator">The implicit multiplication operator</h1>

<p>If you‚Äôve taken an abstract algebra class, you‚Äôve seen a function type written as something like</p>

<pre><code>f : Z/2Z √ó Z/2Z -&gt; Z
</code></pre>

<p>Ignoring the arrow and colon (which have lower precedence than everything else), we have the type</p>

<pre><code>Z/2Z √ó Z/2Z
</code></pre>

<p>which represents a pair of integers modulo 2. The correct parenthesization of this type is thus</p>

<pre><code>(Z/(2Z))√ó(Z/(2Z))
</code></pre>

<p>For a less esoteric example, how would you read the following formula?</p>

<pre><code>T = PV/nR
</code></pre>

<p>I think most people would correctly parenthesize this as <code>T = (PV)/(nR)</code> not <code>T = P(V/n)R</code>.</p>

<p>Note that we don‚Äôt actually use the standard left-to-right PEMDAS rule here, nor do we prioritize multiplication over division. Instead, we have the following precedence: implicit multiplication, / division, then √ó multiplication.</p>

<h1 id="the-division-bar">The division bar</h1>

<p>Ok so we‚Äôve established that the precedence rule for division and implicit multiplication is such that implicit multiplication works differently from √ó multiplication. We‚Äôve also kinda justified that the answer should really be 1 by standard conventions in higher math</p>

<p>The thing is that the division bar is a really weird object ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt actually used much outside of elementary school mathematics. Typically outside that context either a full division bar \(\frac 2 3\) or an inline division bar /. That means that in practice there‚Äôs no actual convention about the relationship between √∑ and the implicit multiplication operator.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion--tldr">Conclusion / TLDR</h1>

<p>The expression 6 √∑ 2(1+2) is probably the most controversial mathematical expression out there. It is capable of being interpreted differently even among people who definitely understand the standard conventions of mathematical symbology intuitively and fluently.</p>

<p>It is not just a normal level of unnecessarily confusing, it is <em>adversarial</em> in it‚Äôs confusingness.</p>

<p>STOP POSTING IT. BLOCK ALL WHO POST IT. DISENGAGE WITH DISCOURSE SURROUNDING IT.</p>
