So, I was reading <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/"><em>Category Theory for Scientists</em></a> recently and kept having people ask me: What <em>is</em> category theory? Well, until I hit chapter 3-4, I didnâ€™t really have an answer. But now I do, and I realize that to just understand what it is doesnâ€™t really require understanding how it works.</p>

<h2 id="sets-and-functions">Sets and functions</h2>

<p>So, set theory is all about sets and functions. Why are we talking about set theory and not category theory, you may ask? Iâ€™ll get to category theory eventually, but for now, letâ€™s discuss something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s look at subsets of the set \(\{a, b\}\). We have the possibilities, which we name <b>E</b>mpty, <b>A</b> set, <b>B</b> set, <b>U</b>niversal set:</p>

<p>\[E = \{\}, A = \{a\}, B = \{b\}, U = \{a, b\}\]</p>
