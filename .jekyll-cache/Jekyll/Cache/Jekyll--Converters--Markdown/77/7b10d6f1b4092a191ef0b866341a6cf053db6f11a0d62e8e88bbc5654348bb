I"Î<p>OK, so a bit of a silly question. Of course, we all know what numbers are. But humor me, and try to define a number without using ‚Äúnumber‚Äù, ‚Äúquantity‚Äù, or anything that refers back to a number itself.</p>

<p>But, before we learn numbers, we have to first understand something simpler: counting. Couldn‚Äôt we define numbers in terms of counting? Well, yes, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this article.</p>

<p>Now, to not end up with a forty page book, I‚Äôm only going to go over how to define the whole numbers (I‚Äôm going to ignore negative integers, fractions, \(\pi\), etc.)</p>

<!--end excerpt-->

<p>Basically, a mathematician named Peano had a similar idea back in the 1800s. Back then, even mathematicians didn‚Äôt really know what numbers were. Some of them felt that they were simple enough that they didn‚Äôt need a definition. On the other hand, some mathematicians liked thinking about numbers in terms of geometry. Like if I draw one line, that‚Äôs 1. If I draw another line 2 times as long next to it, that‚Äôs 2, etc. It works, but it‚Äôs a bit annoying to have to work with geometry all the time. Unless you like drawing, which a lot of people go into math to avoid.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Peano. During the 1800s, mathematicians were starting to ask some weirdly difficult questions. Like, how do we know that \(a + b = b + a\)? How do we even know that \(2 + 2 = 4\)? How do we even know that \(4\) exists?</p>

<p>Well, we need to start somewhere, and Peano decided we needed a few basic Laws Of Mathematics for numbers (mathematicians like the word <em>axiom</em>). These are rules that are considered self-evident.</p>

<p>He came up with a total of 9. In advanced 21st century mathematics, there are generally considered to be 5. (No, it didn‚Äôt turn out that \(9 = 5\). 4 of the axioms are really part of logic. Stuff like if \(a = b\), \(b = a\). In the 19th century, they didn‚Äôt really distinguish logic from math, but now we do.)</p>

<p>Anyway, let‚Äôs go through the Laws!</p>

<h2 id="1-zero-is-a-number">1. Zero is a Number</h2>

<p>OK, so \(0\) is a number! Very useful.</p>

<p>Actually, we don‚Äôt have to call this \(0\). Let‚Äôs call it <code>Peano</code>.</p>

<p>Now <code>Peano</code> is a number! That‚Äôs better! Actually, no, it‚Äôs exactly the same.</p>

<p>All this Law Of Mathematics says is that there is some number. We haven‚Äôt really said what this number <em>does</em> yet. Let‚Äôs move on.</p>

<h2 id="2-for-every-number-n-there-is-a-number-n_s">2. For every number \(n\), there is a number \(n_S\).</h2>

<p>OK, so we know that for every number, there is another number! We have defined here basically the concept of counting. \(n_S\) is the ‚Äúnext number‚Äù. Are we done?</p>

<p>Well, no, because I told you that there are 5 Laws Of Mathematics, and we‚Äôve only covered 2.</p>

<p>Also, think about it for a second. Have we really defined counting? Does this definition tell us that we can‚Äôt, for example, have \(0_S = 0\)?</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/zero-circ.png" width="50%" /></p>

<p>No. What it does tell us, however, is that we can‚Äôt have two different \(n_S\) for the same \(n\).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/non-function.png" width="50%" /></p>

<h2 id="3-there-is-no-number-n-where-n_s--0">3. There is no number \(n\) where \(n_S = 0\)</h2>

<p>OK! We dealt with that annoying \(0_S = 0\) problem! We‚Äôre done! Well, no‚Ä¶ Try to think about a problem with this yourself before you move on.</p>

<p>Here it is: Let‚Äôs define \(0_S = 1\). Now, is there anything that says that you can‚Äôt have \(\beta_S = 1\) where \(\beta \neq 0\)?</p>

<p>Well, no. We have some \(0\) (this follows Law of Mathematics #1). We have, \(0_S = 1\), \(\beta_S = 1\), \(1_S = 2\) (by definition), etc. (this follows Law of Mathematics #2). We have no element \(x\) such that \(x_S = 0\) (this follows Law of Mathematics #3).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/non-1-to-1.png" /></p>

<p>Well, we have something that is obviously ridiculous but follows all the Laws. Well, let‚Äôs close the loophole!</p>

<h2 id="4-for-any-two-numbers-x-and-y-if-x_s--y_s-x--y">4. For any two numbers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x_S = y_S\), \(x = y\)</h2>

<p>OK! We‚Äôre finally done! No more weird numbers that feed into the regular numbers!</p>

<p>So now let‚Äôs define a few numbers:</p>

<p>\[0_S = 1\]
\[1_S = 2\]
\[2_S = 3\]
\[3_S = 4\]</p>

<p>OK, seems to be working. Now let‚Äôs define a few more.</p>

<p>\[\gamma_S = \beta\]
\[\beta_S = \alpha\]</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/two-chains.png" /></p>

<p>Where did those annoying Greek letters come from! Well, we‚Äôve said what can be a number: the \(0, 0_S, 0_{SS}, 0_{SSS}\) etc. And we‚Äôve said that no number is before \(0\). And we‚Äôve said that no two numbers can feed into the same number.</p>

<p>However, what we haven‚Äôt said is that the only numbers are \(0, 0_S, 0_{SS}, 0_{SSS}\), etc. And, guess what? That‚Äôs the fifth Law!</p>

<h2 id="5-if-something-is-true-for-n--0-and-its-being-true-for-n-makes-it-true-for-n_s-then-it-is-true-for-all-numbers">5. If something is true for \(n = 0\) and its being true for \(n\) makes it true for \(n_S\), then it is true for all numbers.</h2>

<p>OK, so this is a little more complicated than the previous examples. But let‚Äôs look at a quick example to see how it completes the definition of the numbers. \(\newcommand{\isn}{\uplus}\)</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at the symbol \(\isn\). Basically, \(x_\isn = \true\), or true when \(x\) is a number, and \(\false\), or false, whenever it is not. (I got the symbol by typing ‚Äúfancy math symbols‚Äù into Google. As far as I know, it isn‚Äôt commonly used.)</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>\[0_\isn = \true\<br />
1_\isn = \true\<br />
2_\isn = \true\<br />
\spadesuit_\isn = \false\<br />
\diamondsuit_\isn = \false\]</p>

<p>As you can see, suits of cards are not numbers, but \(0, 1, 2\) are.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first two axioms can be said as ‚Äú\(0_\isn\)‚Äù and ‚Äúif \(n_\isn\), then \((n_S)_ \isn\)‚Äù</p>

<p>This means that \(n_\isn\) is true for all numbers.</p>

<p>Let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>OK, so basically, we proved that all numbers are numbers. But that was just to show that the fifth Law of Mathematics makes sense.</p>

<p>Now for a better example: let‚Äôs look at trying to get rid of those annoying Greek Letters. We defined \(\beta\) as some number which isn‚Äôt‚Äô the successor of anything in a chain that comes from 0. Let‚Äôs define unbetaness as \(n \neq \beta\). We know that \(0 \neq \beta\), and we know that if \(n \neq \beta\) and \(n\) is a number, \(n_S \neq \beta\). Therefore, no number is equal to \(\beta\), so \(\beta\) is not a number.</p>

<p>Now we‚Äôre actually done! Well, not really, because we still don‚Äôt know what \(2 + 2\) is, since we don‚Äôt know what \(+\) means. Let‚Äôs look at the Laws of Addition.</p>

<h2 id="1-0--n--n">1. \(0 + n = n\)</h2>

<p>Adding nothing to something doesn‚Äôt change it. Not particularly crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="2-a_s--b--a--b_-s">2. \(a_S + b = (a + b)_ S\)</h2>

<p>Counting up one of the numbers does the same thing as counting up the sum. In other words, if you have two piles, adding a stone to one of the piles is the same as adding a stone to the system as a whole.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-is-2--2">So, what <em>is</em> \(2 + 2\)?</h1>

<p>\[2 + 2\<br />
1_S + 2\<br />
(1 + 2)_ S\<br />
(0_S + 2)_ S\<br />
((0 + 2)_ S)_ S\<br />
(2_ S)_ S\<br />
3_ S\<br />
4\]</p>

<p>So, you‚Äôre wrong, Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2+2=5">\(2 + 2\) is <em>not</em> 5!</a></p>

<p>Anyway, the real point is that while before, you probably thought that \(2 + 2 = 4\) was a basic fact, a Law of Mathematics, now you know that it is just a deduction based on a few other, simpler, laws.</p>
