I"­<p>So Iâ€™ve been trying to go through <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/"><em>Category Theory for Scientists</em></a> by writing the functions as code. So I obviously decided to use Haskell. Unfortunately, I ran into a wall: Haskell is actually pretty bad at representing categories.</p>

<h2 id="haskell-is-a-category">Haskell is <em>a</em> Category</h2>

<p>Now, at first this was incredibly surprising. Frankly, I had started learning about category theory because of its association with Haskell. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t realize that Haskell isnâ€™t category theory, itâ€™s a category.</p>

<p>For instance, look at this definition of a category in math:</p>
