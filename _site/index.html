        What's a number?

    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-11-24T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">24 Nov 2015</time>

    <p>OK, so a bit of a silly question. Of course, we all know what numbers are. But humor me, and try to define a number without using “number”, “quantity”, or anything that refers back to a number itself.</p>

<p>But, before we learn numbers, we have to first understand something simpler: counting. Couldn’t we define numbers in terms of counting? Well, yes, otherwise I wouldn’t be writing this article.</p>

<p>Now, to not end up with a forty page book, I’m only going to go over how to define the whole numbers (I’m going to ignore negative integers, fractions, \(\pi\), etc.)</p>

<p>Basically, a mathematician named Peano had a similar idea back in the 1800s. Back then, even mathematicians didn’t really know what numbers were. Some of them felt that they were simple enough that they didn’t need a definition. On the other hand, some mathematicians liked thinking about numbers in terms of geometry. Like if I draw one line, that’s 1. If I draw another line 2 times as long next to it, that’s 2, etc. It works, but it’s a bit annoying to have to work with geometry all the time. Unless you like drawing, which a lot of people go into math to avoid.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Peano. During the 1800s, mathematicians were starting to ask some weirdly difficult questions. Like, how do we know that \(a + b = b + a\)? How do we even know that \(2 + 2 = 4\)? How do we even know that \(4\) exists?</p>

<p>Well, we need to start somewhere, and Peano decided we needed a few basic Laws Of Mathematics for numbers (mathematicians like the word <em>axiom</em>). These are rules that are considered self-evident.</p>

<p>He came up with a total of 9. In advanced 21st century mathematics, there are generally considered to be 5. (No, it didn’t turn out that \(9 = 5\). 4 of the axioms are really part of logic. Stuff like if \(a = b\), \(b = a\). In the 19th century, they didn’t really distinguish logic from math, but now we do.)</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s go through the Laws!</p>

<h2 id="zero-is-a-number">1. Zero is a Number</h2>

<p>OK, so \(0\) is a number! Very useful.</p>

<p>Actually, we don’t have to call this \(0\). Let’s call it <code>Peano</code>.</p>

<p>Now <code>Peano</code> is a number! That’s better! Actually, no, it’s exactly the same.</p>

<p>All this Law Of Mathematics says is that there is some number. We haven’t really said what this number <em>does</em> yet. Let’s move on.</p>

<h2 id="for-every-number-n-there-is-a-number-ns">2. For every number \(n\), there is a number \(n_S\).</h2>

<p>OK, so we know that for every number, there is another number! We have defined here basically the concept of counting. \(n_S\) is the “next number”. Are we done?</p>

<p>Well, no, because I told you that there are 5 Laws Of Mathematics, and we’ve only covered 2.</p>

<p>Also, think about it for a second. Have we really defined counting? Does this definition tell us that we can’t, for example, have \(0_S = 0\)?</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/zero-circ.png" width="50%" /></p>

<p>No. What it does tell us, however, is that we can’t have two different \(n_S\) for the same \(n\).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/non-function.png" width="50%" /></p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-number-n-where-ns--0">3. There is no number \(n\) where \(n_S = 0\)</h2>

<p>OK! We dealt with that annoying \(0_S = 0\) problem! We’re done! Well, no… Try to think about a problem with this yourself before you move on.</p>

<p>Here it is: Let’s define \(0_S = 1\). Now, is there anything that says that you can’t have \(\beta_S = 1\) where \(\beta \neq 0\)?</p>

<p>Well, no. We have some \(0\) (this follows Law of Mathematics #1). We have, \(0_S = 1\), \(\beta_S = 1\), \(1_S = 2\) (by definition), etc. (this follows Law of Mathematics #2). We have no element \(x\) such that \(x_S = 0\) (this follows Law of Mathematics #3).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/non-1-to-1.png" /></p>

<p>Well, we have something that is obviously ridiculous but follows all the Laws. Well, let’s close the loophole!</p>

<h2 id="for-any-two-numbers-x-and-y-if-xs--ys-x--y">4. For any two numbers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x_S = y_S\), \(x = y\)</h2>

<p>OK! We’re finally done! No more weird numbers that feed into the regular numbers!</p>

<p>So now let’s define a few numbers:</p>

<p>\[0_S = 1\]<br />
\[1_S = 2\]<br />
\[2_S = 3\]<br />
\[3_S = 4\]</p>

<p>OK, seems to be working. Now let’s define a few more.</p>

<p>\[\gamma_S = \beta\]<br />
\[\beta_S = \alpha\]</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/resources/2015-11-24/two-chains.png" /></p>

<p>Where did those annoying Greek letters come from! Well, we’ve said what can be a number: the \(0, 0_S, 0_{SS}, 0_{SSS}\) etc. And we’ve said that no number is before \(0\). And we’ve said that no two numbers can feed into the same number.</p>

<p>However, what we haven’t said is that the only numbers are \(0, 0_S, 0_{SS}, 0_{SSS}\), etc. And, guess what? That’s the fifth Law!</p>

<h2 id="if-something-is-true-for-n--0-and-its-being-true-for-n-makes-it-true-for-ns-then-it-is-true-for-all-numbers">5. If something is true for \(n = 0\) and its being true for \(n\) makes it true for \(n_S\), then it is true for all numbers.</h2>

<p>OK, so this is a little more complicated than the previous examples. But let’s look at a quick example to see how it completes the definition of the numbers. \(\newcommand{\isn}{\uplus}\)</p>

<p>Let’s look at the symbol \(\isn\). Basically, \(x_\isn = \true\), or true when \(x\) is a number, and \(\false\), or false, whenever it is not. (I got the symbol by typing “fancy math symbols” into Google. As far as I know, it isn’t commonly used.)</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>\[0_\isn = \true\\<br />
1_\isn = \true\\<br />
2_\isn = \true\\<br />
\spadesuit_\isn = \false\\<br />
\diamondsuit_\isn = \false\]</p>

<p>As you can see, suits of cards are not numbers, but \(0, 1, 2\) are.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first two axioms can be said as “\(0_\isn\)” and “if \(n_\isn\), then \((n_S)_ \isn\)”</p>

<p>This means that \(n_\isn\) is true for all numbers.</p>

<p>Let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>OK, so basically, we proved that all numbers are numbers. But that was just to show that the fifth Law of Mathematics makes sense.</p>

<p>Now for a better example: let’s look at trying to get rid of those annoying Greek Letters. We defined \(\beta\) as some number which isn’t’ the successor of anything in a chain that comes from 0. Let’s define unbetaness as \(n \neq \beta\). We know that \(0 \neq \beta\), and we know that if \(n \neq \beta\) and \(n\) is a number, \(n_S \neq \beta\). Therefore, no number is equal to \(\beta\), so \(\beta\) is not a number.</p>

<p>Now we’re actually done! Well, not really, because we still don’t know what \(2 + 2\) is, since we don’t know what \(+\) means. Let’s look at the Laws of Addition.</p>

<h2 id="n--n">1. \(0 + n = n\)</h2>

<p>Adding nothing to something doesn’t change it. Not particularly crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="as--b--a--b-s">2. \(a_S + b = (a + b)_ S\)</h2>

<p>Counting up one of the numbers does the same thing as counting up the sum. In other words, if you have two piles, adding a stone to one of the piles is the same as adding a stone to the system as a whole.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-is-2--2">So, what <em>is</em> \(2 + 2\)?</h1>

<p>\[2 + 2\\<br />
1_S + 2\\<br />
(1 + 2)_ S\\<br />
(0_S + 2)_ S\\<br />
((0 + 2)_ S)_ S\\<br />
(2_ S)_ S\\<br />
3_ S\\<br />
4\]</p>

<p>So, you’re wrong, Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2+2=5">\(2 + 2\) is <em>not</em> 5!</a></p>

<p>Anyway, the real point is that while before, you probably thought that \(2 + 2 = 4\) was a basic fact, a Law of Mathematics, now you know that it is just a deduction based on a few other, simpler, laws.</p>
